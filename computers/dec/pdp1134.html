                            <p>This is the oldest working computer in my collection and, in my opinion, the most
                                impressive. This particular PDP came from a college, where it was sold by Tektronix to
                                operate test equipment. The computer and drives have Tektronix serial numbers, and there
                                is also a Tektronix HP-IB interface card used for connecting to the equipment.</p>

                            <p>My PDP has the following cards installed:</p>

                                <li>M9202 - Unibus jumper</li>
                                <li>2x M7891 - 128KB / 64Kword Memory</li>

                            </ul>

                                Currently, I run the system with the RL11 controller removed and a <a

                                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Unibone</a> in its place. The Unibone allows me to emulate
                                drives, letting me experiment with more operating systems while also preserving the
                                RL01s from wear.

                                This PDP came with two RL01 removable pack disk drives, each holding 5MB on a single
                                platter. I only have two disk packs, and RL01 packs are much rarer than RL02s, which is
                                a big reason why I opted for the Unibone. The first disk pack contained only XXDP+
                                diagnostics, while the second had an installation of Tektronix SPS BASIC, a custom
                                dialect of BASIC developed by Tektronix based on Dartmouth BASIC. I uploaded an image of
                                the disk <a href="https://archive.org/details/TEKSPS" target="_blank"

                                . You can easily boot this image in SIMH on an emulated 11/34A. Some manuals for Tek SPS
                                BASIC can be found

                                When I received the system, one of the H7441 5V regulators was broken. With help from
                                some people on the VCFed forum, I was able to repair it. <a
