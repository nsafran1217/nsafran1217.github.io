                            <p>This was the first Digital computer I acquired. The system came with a 100MB and a 200MB
                                hard disk installed, but I currently leave them disconnected to avoid potential damage,
                                both to the drives and to the OpenVMS 6.2 installation. Instead, I use a BlueSCSI V2
                                with multiple virtual hard disks, allowing me to easily boot different operating
                                systems.</p>

                            <p>I've been experimenting with OpenVMS 7.3, the last version released for VAX. This is my
                                first experience with OpenVMS, and it's a very different environment compared to Windows
                                or UNIX.</p>
                            <p>I was able to install and configure TCP/IP, as well as the <a
                                    href="https://wasd.vsm.com.au/">WASD web server</a>. Compiling WASD took about 10
                                hours on this system, and even a simple HTML webpage with four pictures takes around
                                five seconds to load.</p>
                            <p>I've tested several operating systems, including OpenVMS 7.3, Ultrix 4.5, and NetBSD.
                                NetBSD was particularly interesting since it's a modern OS running on old
                                hardwareâ€”though generating SSH keys took about 45 minutes.</p>
                            <h2>Mouse Adapter</h2>
                            <p>I don't have a DEC mouse, so I assembled a converter board using <a
                                    href="https://hackaday.io/project/19576-dec-mouse-adapter">this code.</a>
                                <br>EEventually, I want to build a USB-based mouse and keyboard adapter using a
                                Raspberry Pi Pico.
                            </p>
