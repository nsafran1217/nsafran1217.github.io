                            <h2>SGI Altix 3700 and Altix 350</h2>
                            <p>I recently acquired both of these systems, just before they were nearly scrapped. While I was able to save the NUMAlink cables and the systems themselves, the racks were unfortunately already gone. Along with them, there was a UV1000 and an Altix 4700, but their racks and blade chassis had also been scrapped--only the blades remained. The L2 controllers were gone as well.

                                <p>I haven't had much time to go through everything yet, but the 3700 appears to be working correctly. The 350, however, has a few bricks that didn't power up, and I still need to investigate the issue."</p>
