                            <h2>Indigo2</h2>
                            <p>The Indigo2 was the first Silicon Graphics machine I acquired, and I'd love to add the
                                purple model with High Impact graphics to my collection someday.<br />
                                My system is equipped with a 150 MHz R4400 processor, 128MB of RAM, and GR3-XZ graphics.
                                Also known as Express graphics, the XZ board set consists of two stacked boards. It
                                features two Geometry Engines, one Reality Engine, and a Z-buffer, supporting 24-bit
                                color.
                            <p>It runs IRIX 6.5.22 on a 36GB SCSI hard disk. Since I don't have many 50-pin SCSI drives,
                                I used an adapter to convert from 50-pin SCSI to 80-pin SCA, as I have plenty of SCA
                                drives from old servers. The fit is tight, and it slightly bends the drive's circuit
                                board, but I haven't had any issues.</p>
                            <p>When I first got the system, the graphics output had a problemâ€”the screen was covered in
                                vertical lines, though the mouse cursor appeared correctly on top. Fortunately, all it
                                took to fix the issue was separating the graphics board set and reseating all the
                                connections.
                            </p>
                            <p>I recently acquired a second Indigo2; a purple one with an R4400 250 MHz and Extreme
                                graphics. </p>
