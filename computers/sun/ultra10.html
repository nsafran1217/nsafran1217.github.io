                            <h2>Ultra 10</h2>
                            <p>TThe Ultra 5 and Ultra 10 were the first Sun computers to adopt a more PC-like
                                architecture. Both feature a PCI bus and IDE controllers for the hard disk and CD-ROM
                                instead of SCSI. They still use Sun's proprietary keyboard interface unlike the later
                                SunBlade series.</p>

                            <p>This Ultra 10 is well-equipped with a 333 MHz UltraSPARC IIi, 256MB of RAM, an 80GB IDE
                                hard disk, a SCSI controller, Creator 3D graphics, and a SunPCI card.</p>

                            <h2>Sun PCi</h2>
                            <p>The SunPCI was Sun's solution for businesses that still needed to run Windows software.
                                It's essentially a single-board computer on a PCI card, with software that passes I/O to
                                Solaris. When launched, it functions similarly to a virtual machineâ€”you'll see the
                                SunPCI boot like a normal PC. The SunPCI hard disk is an image file stored on the
                                Solaris file system, which can be moved like any other file.</p>
                            <p>The SunPCI also has dedicated video output, keyboard, USB, and Ethernet ports, allowing
                                it to be used as a standalone computer if needed.</p>
                            <p>I haven't been able to get the SunPCI working properly on my system. Either I'm missing
                                patches, or I'm using an incompatible version of Solaris. Eventually, I plan to try
                                installing Solaris 9 to see if that improves compatibility.
                                <br>NCommander made an in-depth video about the SunPCI here: <a
