Each pack holds 5MB on a single platter. I only have the 2 disk packs, and RL01 packs are a lot more rare than RL02s, which is a big reason why I got the Unibone. The first disk pack was just XXDP+ diagnostics. The second was an install of Tektronix SPS Basic, a custom basic dialect made by tek based on Dartmouth basic. I uploaded an image of the disk <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/TEKSPS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. You can boot this image in simh on an emulated 11/34a easily.
