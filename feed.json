I liked it because the color reminded me of an Altair 8800. I 3D printed some parts to help hold the PSU I chose and the disk drives. The PSU is something I pulled out of a computer years ago, either a Dell or Compaq. The backplane is sandwiched in between two 3D printed pieces. Bolts come up through the bottom of the chassis through the  guide rails for the PCBs to hold the entire assembly together. I'm not happy with this design. Eventually I want to get a larger backplane so I can install more cards. Right now, I can't fit everything at the same time.</p>\n<p>The backplane is just a 40 row strip board with pin headers soldered on it.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221022_213609-2.jpg\" data-size=\"2565x1625\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221022_213609-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"456\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221025_222821-2.jpg\" data-size=\"2819x2267\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221025_222821-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"579\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>",

Eventually, a floppy controller will be added to this board. <br>The hard disk is connected directly to the Z80's bus. I'm considering re-making this board and adding bus transceivers for both the IDE disk and the FDD controller. So far, I've only found 1 model of hard disk that works with this setup, and I'm assuming its because there's no bus transceiver. Only 8 bits of the 16 bit data bus on the hard disk is used. The other top 8 are pulled to ground. The only chip on the board is a 3 to 8 demux for address decoding.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/26/gallery/20221025_222715.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/26/gallery/20221025_222715-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Board</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/26/gallery/IDE-board-sch.png\" data-size=\"1576x1260\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/26/gallery/IDE-board-sch-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"576\"></a>\n<figcaption>Schematic</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>Software</h2>\n<p>To be added.</p>",

I've made some changes to it in 2020 when I started to add more boards to the system. Before, the address decoding was done with a few different 74LS logic chips.

The system has a 100MB and a 200MB hard disk installed. Currently, I leave them disconnected because I don't want to damage them, or damage the install of OpenVMS 6.2 since I have no idea how to use OpenVMS.</p>\n<p>The reason I have the front panel removed is so I can easily plug in my <a href=\"https://github.com/akuker/RASCSI\">RaSCSI</a> to the SCSI bus. I don't have the correct cable to connect to the external SCSI connector on the back.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/21/20221008_183428-Copy.jpg\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/21/responsive/20221008_183428-Copy-xs.jpg 300w ,https://nsafran.com/media/posts/21/responsive/20221008_183428-Copy-sm.jpg 480w ,https://nsafran.com/media/posts/21/responsive/20221008_183428-Copy-md.jpg 768w ,https://nsafran.com/media/posts/21/responsive/20221008_183428-Copy-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://nsafran.com/media/posts/21/responsive/20221008_183428-Copy-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://nsafran.com/media/posts/21/responsive/20221008_183428-Copy-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"2480\" height=\"2268\"></figure>\n<p>I've tested a few different operating systems including OpenVMS 7.2, Ultrix 4.5, and NetBSD. NetBSD was interesting since it's a new OS. The SSH keys took about 45 minutes to generate. I don't think I'm going to take the effort to learn OpenVMS, but I'd like to get an OS with a GUI running on it.</p>",
