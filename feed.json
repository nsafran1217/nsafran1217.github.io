My system came with a dummy load installed where the hard disk would be, so I'm assuming it never had a hard disk and net booted Sun OS when it was in server.</p>\n<p>I installed a 2.1 GB Hard disk and purchased a SCSI cable for it. Of Course, the NVRAM battery was dead. I repaired it by bypassing the internal battery and installing an external battery holder as described on this page. <a href=\"http://www.tns-soft.com/nvram_redux.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sun NVRAM Repair</a></p>\n<p>The system currently has 40MB of RAM and is running SunOS 4.1.4, the last release of the BSD based operating system <span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">by Sun. The GUI on SunOS is pretty simplistic compared to the later versions of Solaris, but it works. I compiled some modern tools for it including bash, tar, gzip, and other. Its definitely the slowest workstation I have, but I enjoy messing around with it.</span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20221008_131728.jpg\" data-size=\"1863x1846\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20221008_131728-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"713\"></a>\n<figcaption>System and Hard Disk</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220121_170012.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220121_170012-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>NVRAM Repair</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20221008_132538.jpg\" data-size=\"2400x2025\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20221008_132538-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"608\"></a>\n<figcaption>OpenWindows</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h2>External Hard Disk</h2>\n<p>I really like the form factor, so I purchased an external hard disk on ebay to go with it. This disk was sold as not working, does not power up. When it arrived, I opened up the PSU and saw what I expected, leaking capacitors. I ordered replacements on DigiKey for the 4 large capacitors and replaced them. Luckily that was the only issue with the supply.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220203_181019.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220203_181019-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Capacitors removed</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220203_182954.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220203_182954-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>New Caps</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220203_185322.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/5/gallery/20220203_185322-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Compared to a new SSD</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>",
