I liked it because the color reminded me of an Altair 8800. I 3D printed some parts to help hold the PSU (from an old Dell PC) and the disk drives. The backplane is sandwiched in between two 3D printed pieces. Bolts come up through the bottom of the chassis through the  guide rails for the PCBs to hold the entire assembly together. I'm not happy with this design. Eventually I want to get a larger backplane so I can install more cards.

I'm considering re-making this board and adding bus transceivers for both the IDE disk and the FDD controller. So far, I've only found 1 model of hard disk that works with this setup, and I'm assuming its because there's no bus transceiver. Only 8 bits of the 16 bit data bus on the hard disk is used. The other top 8 are pulled to ground.
