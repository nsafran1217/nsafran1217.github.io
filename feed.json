When I entered \"arc\" at the SRM console, the console would say \"ARC firmware loaded\" and freeze. I found a post on <a href=\"https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=89289&amp;p=1093248\">vogons</a> that described a similar problem on an alphastation. Doing the same repair on the Dallas DS1287 TOY NVRAM fixed my issue.</p>\n<p>So far I have OpenVMS 8.4 installed on the system.

I liked it because the color reminded me of an Altair 8800. I 3D printed some parts to help hold the PSU (from an old Dell PC) and the disk drives. The backplane is sandwiched in between two 3D printed pieces. Bolts come up through the bottom of the chassis through the  guide rails for the PCBs to hold the entire assembly together. I'm not happy with this design. Eventually I want to get a larger backplane so I can install more cards. Right now, I can't fit everything at the same time.</p>\n<p>The backplane is just a 40 row strip board with pin headers soldered on it.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221022_213609-2.jpg\" data-size=\"2565x1625\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221022_213609-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"456\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221025_222821-2.jpg\" data-size=\"2819x2267\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://nsafran.com/media/posts/30/gallery/20221025_222821-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"579\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>",
