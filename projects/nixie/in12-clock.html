                            <p>This was the first project I completed with professionally made boards. I used JLCPCB
                                since they were inexpensive.<br>
                                This was also the first time I used an EDA tool. I chose Eagle because there were many
                                tutorials available.</p>
                            <p>I made some mistakes related to trace spacing. I used the same spacing for all signals,
                                and I think the HV traces are still too close.</p>
                            <p>The code is messy, but it works well for what it is. I did have to make one modification
                                to the board to bring 5V out to the connector for the rotary encoder, but that was a
                                simple bodge wire fix.</p>
                            <p>After the board and code were working, I designed a case to 3D print. The case is
                                assembled using only four long screws, one in each corner. All the sides are made of
                                Lexan, allowing you to see every side of the clock.</p>
