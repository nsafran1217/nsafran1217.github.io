                                This project is mostly finished. I still want to modify some of the animations I created
                                and replace the 3D-printed front panel with one made from aluminum.<br>

                            <p>
                                This clock is powered by an ESP32 and features an IN-12 Nixie tube clock, a 12Ã—10 INS-1
                                neon indicator matrix, and a six-character IV-17 VFD display. It retrieves time and
                                weather data from the internet at regular intervals and can display either current or
                                future
                                weather, or cycle between both. The current weather time frame being displayed is
                                indicated by an
                                AL102 LED.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                All of the displays, including the LEDs, are Soviet surplus, so I wanted the clock to
                                resemble an old piece of Soviet military equipment. All front panel lettering and
                                messages displayed on the alphanumeric IV-17 tubes are written in Russian.
                            </p>

                                This clock incorporates three circuit boards I designed, plus one additional hand-made
                                board.<br>

                            <p>
                                For the high-voltage power supply, I use an
                                <a href="https://omnixie.com/products/nch6300hv-nixie-hv-power-module">NCH6300HV</a> by
                                Omnixie. I used their older design in my first Nixie clock and was pleased with its
                                performance.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The clock is powered by 12V through a USB-C connection. A small power trigger board
                                requests 12V from the USB adapter.<br>
                                When the adapter is first plugged in, 5V is supplied to the clock. Some voltage reaches
                                the 7805 voltage regulator that powers the ESP32, but not enough to turn it on. After a
                                few
                                seconds, the voltage increases to 12V, and the ESP32 begins bringing up the other power
                                supplies.
                                I have not encountered any issues with this arrangement.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A buck converter generates the 2.4V required for the VFD filaments, while a boost
                                converter
                                produces the 25V needed for the anode voltage. A linear regulator provides 5V for the
                                VFD and
                                Nixie board, which also powers the ESP32.
